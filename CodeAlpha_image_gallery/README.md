## ‚Äã Features

##  Demo Snapshot

Here‚Äôs what the gallery looks like in action:

- A header that reads "**My Image Gallery**".
- Filter buttons labeled "All", "Nature", "City", "People".
- A grid of sample images (3 images repeated across categories).
- A lightbox overlay featuring **√ó**, **<**, and **>** controls for easy navigation.

## ‚Äã How It Works

- **Event Listeners**:
  - Each thumbnail opens the lightbox with the selected image.
  - Keyboard navigation and lightbox close behavior (Escape key, clicking overlay).
  - Filtering links `data-filter` buttons to `data-category` attributes on images.

- **Lightbox Functionality**:
  - Manages current image index, updates the main lightbox image.
  - Navigation wraps around from last to first image seamlessly.

- **Filtering System**:
  - Checks each image‚Äôs `data-category` value against the chosen filter.
  - Uses simple style toggling (`display: block`/`none`) for show/hide effects.
